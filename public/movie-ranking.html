<h1>My Favourite Films According To Hanifah</h1>
<h2>Top 3 Films</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Not quite a single film, but this trilogy takes the number one spot. With rougish orcs, headstrong dwarves and all manner of fantasy figures, J.R.R Tolkien's incredible creation never fails to disappoint in its film adaptation.</p>
<h3>Coraline</h3>
<p>Another wonderful book adaptation. This film never loses its supernatural sting.</p>
<h3>The Truman Show</h3>
<p>Wow! A film that is as contemporary as it ever will be. Our protaganist lives to be seen, heard, followed and watched. . . all without him knowing of course.</p>
